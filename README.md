**Lekanmastermind**
===================


Welcome to mastermind. This is a classic code breaking game between two players. In this implementation, It is between a player and the computer.
The player selects the level(Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) in which He/She wants to play and the computer generates Colour sequence based on the level chosen. The game is won when a player correctly guesses the computer sequence or the player runs out of guesses: there are 12 guesses for a player.
